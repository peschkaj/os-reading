# os-reading

An operating systems reading list.

## Teaching Operating Systems

These operating systems specifically focusing on being resources for teaching
and learning. The Linux kernel is too complex for easy learning and
understanding, so instead we focus on these other operating systems to make it
easier to study specific concepts and ideas in isolation.

* [xv6](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public)
* [Raspberry Pi OS](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os)
* [Writing an OS in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com)

* [Writing a Simple OS From Scratch](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf)

Not specifically teaching operating systems, but they're still interesting to learn from:

* [Google Fuchsia](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/docs/+/master/development/source_code/README.md)
* [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org)
* [LittleKernel](https://github.com/littlekernel/lk)

## Courses
